# Protopie Demo
### Overview 
This project opens two browser windows of equal sizes to ICL and ICC. The two windows are defaulted to google.com, which can be changed via the "url" variables in the icl.qml and icc.qml files, respectively. 
### How to Run
To build this project:
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the base directory
3. Run "./scripts/browser.sh"
### Future Edits
Scaling the windows efficiently as a command line option will be implemented soon. In the meantime, they are simply set to the sizes of the ICL and ICC.
